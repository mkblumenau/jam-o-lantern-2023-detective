Concepts for what to add:
	Evidence collection
		This can be a page in the menu accessible only in the game
			It shows a list of what evidence the player has found, along with descriptions
			Maybe use an array to collect the names of all evidence shown
			In the menu, for each possible piece of evidence in the array, show some text describing it
			
	Cooperation/pressure meters
		Meters for all players are shown in a page in the menu
		Meters for currently-relevant characters are shown onscreen
			Use screen bars
